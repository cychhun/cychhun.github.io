In a world where artificial intelligence is being increasingly used for a wide variety of tasks, it becomes ever more necessary to guide AI development towards a responsible stance. In that regard, the [OECD AI Principles](https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles), adopted in 2019 and updated in 2024, aim at promoting innovative and trustworthy AI through a unified set of guidelines.

The five values outlined in the OECD AI principles are the following:
1. Inclusive growth, sustainable development, and well-being
2. Human rights and democratic values, including fairness and privacy
3. Transparency and explainability
4. Robustness, security, and safety
5. Accountability

Those principles are necessary for several reasons.

First, they **ensure public trust**: transparency, safety and accountability are the cornerstones of a resilient society where the public can be confident in the alignment of AI models.

Second, they **build a basis for policymakers** to create regulations that have the citizens' best interests at heart, much like how GDPR helped protect citizens' privacy.

Third, they **drive responsible innovation**, fostering the development of AI systems for objectives that are in tune with the United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).
